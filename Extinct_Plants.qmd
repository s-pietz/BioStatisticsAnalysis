## Extinct Plants 

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

#Read the penguins_samp1 data file from github
plants_wide <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday/master/data/raw_plants/plants_extinct_wide.csv")

#See the first six rows of the data we've read in to our notebook
plants_wide %>%
  head(2) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"))
```
