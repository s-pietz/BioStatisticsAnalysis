## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

#Read the penguins_samp1 data file from github
penguins <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcduryea/Intro-to-Bioinformatics/main/data/penguins_samp1.csv")

#See the first six rows of the data we've read in to our notebook
penguins %>%
  head(2) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"))

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# About our Data

The data we are working with is a data set on Penguins, which includes 8 features measured on 44 penguins. The features included are physiological features (like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, etc) as well as other features like the year that the penguin was observed, the island the penguin was observed on, the sex of the penguin, and the species of the penguin.

# Interesting Questions to Ask

-   What is the average flipper length? What about for each species?

-   Are there more male or female penguins? What about per island or species?

-   What is the average body mass? What about by island? By species? By sex?

-   What is the ratio of bill length to bill depth for a penguin? What is the overall average of this metric? Does it change by species, sex, or island?

-   Does average body mass change by year?

# Tidy analysis HW:

We have created these questions in order to guide our analysis and facilitate our learning on how to use R code and manipulate data in this section. Specifically, we will learn how to filter rows, subset columns, group data, and compute summary statistics.

## Data Manipulation Tools & Strategies

We can look at individual columns in a data set or subsets of columns in a data set. For example, if we are only interested in flipper length and species, we can `select()` those columns.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g)
```

If we want to `filter()` and only show certain rows, we can do that too.

```{r}
#we can filter by sex (categorical variables)
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")

#we can filter by numerical variables 
penguins %>%
  filter(body_mass_g >= 6000)

#we can also do both
penguins %>%
  filter((body_mass_g >= 6000) | (island == "Torgersen"))

```

# Tidy Analysis HW:

Here we created frequency tables. The first table is a 44x2 that shows the species of penguin and its body mass. We then filtered the data again to show certain rows. The second frequency table is a 7x8 that shows the species of the penguin, the island, its bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex of penguin.

# Answering our Questions

Most of our questions involve summarizing data, and perhaps summarizing over groups. We can summarize data using the `summarize()` function, and group data using `group_by()`.

Let's find the average flipper length.

```{r}
#Overall average flipper length
penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm))

#Single Species Average
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Gentoo") %>%
  summarize (avg_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm))

#Grouped Average
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm))
```

# Tidy Analysis HW:

The average flipper length is about 211.63mm

The average flipper length for just the Gentoo species is about 218.42mm

...

How many of each species do we have?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(species)
```

# Tidy Analysis HW:

There are 9 Adelie penguins, 2 Chinstrap penguins, and 3 Gentoo penguins

...

How many of each sex are there? What about by island or species?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(sex)
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  count(sex)
```

# Tidy Analysis HW:

There are 2 female and 2 male. For each species, the Adelie contains 6 female and 3 male, Chinstrap contains 1 female and 1 male, Gentoo contains 1 female and 2 male.

We can use `mutate()` to add new columns to our data set.

```{r}
#To make a permanent change, we need to store the results of our manipulations
penguins_with_ratio
penguins %>%
  mutate(bill_ltd_ratio = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm)

#Average Ratio
penguins %>%
  mutate(bill_ltd_ratio = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_ltd_ratio = mean(bill_ltd_ratio),
            median_bill_ltd_ratio = median(bill_ltd_ratio))

#Average Ratio by Group
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  mutate(bill_ltd_ratio = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_ltd_ratio = mean(bill_ltd_ratio),
            median_bill_ltd_ratio = median(bill_ltd_ratio))

```

Average Body mass by year

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

# Data Visualization

-   What is the distribution of penguin flipper lengths?

-   What is the distribution of penguin species?

-   Does the distribution of flipper length depend on the species of penguin?

    # Tidy Analysis HW:

    We created questions to guide our analysis and data visualization with ggplot. We first visualized the flipper length distribution with a histogram. Based on the first graph, the distribution of penguin flipper lengths is slightly skewed left. We then added more elements to the graph to visually show where the mean and median lie in the data. The mean is represented by a black dashed line and is around 211mm. The median is represented by a yellow dotted line and is around 215mm. This graph helps visualize a single numerical variable with a histogram.

    The second graph shows a distribution of penguin species. The x axis represents the 3 different penguin species and the y axis is the count of each of those species. This graph basically helps us to visualize a categorical variable with a bar plot.

    The third graph is a scatter plot and was created to determine a potential relationship between two numerical variables, bill length and bill depth. This graph is interesting because it represents each species data on the same graph. Therefore, you can see the three different colors representing each of the three different species. The tread lines show us that there is a positive linear relationship between bill length and bill depth in each species.

    ```{r}
    penguins %>%
      ggplot() + 
      geom_histogram( aes(x = flipper_length_mm), 
                      bins = 15, 
                      fill = "red",
                      color = "blue") +
      labs(title = "Distribution of Flipper Length (mm)", 
           subtitle = "Mean in Black, Median in Yellow",
          y = "",
          x = "Flipper Length (mm)" ) +
      geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(flipper_length_mm)), lwd = 2, lty = "dashed" ) +
      geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(flipper_length_mm)), color = "yellow", lwd = 2, lty = "dotted")


    ```

    We will now look at the distribution of species.

```{r}
penguins %>%
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = species), color = "black", fill ="blue") + 
  labs(title = "Counts of Penguin Species")
       x = "Species" , y = "Count")
```

Let's make a scatter plot to see if bill length is correlated with bill depth

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species), method = "lm")


```

# A Final Question

Determine whether the average bill length for a penguin exceeds 45mm? Can you answer only for a subset of penguins or for the entire populations? How certain are you with your answer?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))

t.test(penguins$bill_length_mm, alternative = "greater", mu = 45, conf.level = 0.95)
```

# Tidy Analysis HW:

The average bill length for a penguin does indeed exceed 45mm. The average appears to be 46.37mm. We answered for the entire population.
